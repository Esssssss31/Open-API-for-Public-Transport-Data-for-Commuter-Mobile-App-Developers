from api import app

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

    
# This code simply imports the Flask application from the api package and runs it in debug mode if the file is executed as the main program. 
# The app.run() method starts the Flask development server so that the API can be accessed through HTTP requests.

# The run.py file can be included in the repository if it is necessary for running the API server. 
# However, it's also common practice to have the API server run in a separate environment, 
# such as a Docker container or a server instance on a cloud platform like Google Cloud Platform. 
# In that case, you might not include the run.py file in the repository, but instead provide instructions on how to deploy the API server.
