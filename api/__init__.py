# Python package that handles GTFS feeds for a mobile application

from .api import GTFSAPI
from .feed import GTFSFeed
from .realtime import GTFSRealtime
from .alerts import GTFSAlerts

__all__ = [
    "GTFSAPI",
    "GTFSFeed",
    "GTFSRealtime",
    "GTFSAlerts"
]

# In this example, the __init__.py file imports four modules (api, feed, realtime, and alerts) 
# from the same package and makes them available to users of the package. 
# It also specifies which objects should be included when the package is imported using the __all__ variable

# The GTFSAPI module might contain code for connecting to a GTFS API and retrieving GTFS data. 
# The GTFSFeed module might contain code for parsing a GTFS feed and making the data available to the mobile application. 
# The GTFSRealtime module might contain code for retrieving and processing real-time data, 
# while the GTFSAlerts module might contain code for retrieving and processing service alerts.

# This is just an example, and the contents of the __init__.py file would depend on the specific needs and design of the project.
